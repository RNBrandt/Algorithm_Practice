# Properties for Set
#   - Set can only store unique values
#   - Neither arrays nor hashes can be used for the Set
#   - Elements are stored in nodes as part of linked lists (buckets)
#     - This allows collisions to happen without damaging the data-structure.
#     - Buckets are assigned  by taking the % of the ASCII value of the element, and number of buckets
#   - 8 buckets are instantiated at the creation of the set.
#   - Unique values (sometimes referred to as elements) can be added
#   - Repeat values cannot be added
#   - Values can be deleted
#   - When the number of elements > 75% of the number of buckets, the number of buckets will double, and the values will be redistributed among the new buckets.
#     - This minimizes collisions, and therefore, the time complexity
#   - When the number of elements falls below 25% of the number of buckets, the number of buckets will halve, and the values will be redistributed among the new buckets; however, there will never be fewer than 8 buckets in the Set.
#     - This works to increase storage efficiency


# TESTS TO FOLLOW FOR DEVELOPMENT

# Test for instantiation properties
#   test = Set.new
#   test.buckets (should == 8)
#   test.elements (should == 0)
#   test.is_present(element) (should == false regardless of element's value)

# Test for Linked List (bucket) Properties
#   test.bucket_0.value (should == nil)
#   test.bucket_0.head (should == nil)
#   test.bucket_0.tail (should == nil)
#   test.bucket_0.list_length (should == 0)

# Tests for insert method
#   test.insert(value) (should return no error)
#   test.is_present (value) (should == true)
#     test.elements (should == 1)
#     test.buckets (should == 8)
#   test.insert(repeat value) (should print error and not insert value)
#     test.elements (should == 1)
#     test.buckets (should == 8)
#   test.insert (values * 6) (should return no error)
#     test.elements (should == 7)
#     test.buckets (should == 16)
#   test.is_present(each value) (should == true)

# Tests for delete method (This is the same Set (7 elements and 16 buckets).)
#   test.delete(value (value has been previously inserted)) (should return no error)
#     test.is_present(value) (should return false)
#     test.elements (should return 6)
#     test.buckets (should return 16)
#   test.delete (value (value has not been previously inserted)) (should print error that value is not present in the set)
#     test.is_present(value) (should return false)
#     test.elements (should return 6)
#     test.buckets (should return 16)
#   test.delete(values * 3) (should return no error)
